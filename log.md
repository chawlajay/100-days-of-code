# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Segment tree implementations from [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html).

**Thoughts** Segment trees are very useful when it comes to range queries problems in competitive programming.

**Link to work**
1. [Max queries, sum queries, and many more](https://github.com/chawlajay/algorithms_cpp/tree/main/segmentTrees)

### Day 2: Wednesday, January 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Explored more on Segment trees and completed the tutorial of [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html).
2. Solved 5 problems on SPOJ

**Thoughts** So awesome this tree Data structure is, but needs lots of practice and continuous implementation.

1. [prefix search, first greater element, subsegment with max sum](https://github.com/chawlajay/algorithms_cpp/tree/main/segmentTrees)

### Day 3: Thursday, January 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned and practised about git branches
2. Solved 2 problems on SPOJ

**Thoughts** Git branches is very deep when it comes to local, remote, tracking and non-tracking branches, you get messed up if you don't revise and use it frequently.

**Links I refered to for git branches**
1.  [Github repo](https://t.co/hTtH3AFBeF)
2.  [StackOverFlow Answer](https://t.co/8Sogo6KHMN)
3.  [Video](https://t.co/GssbOXnTfP)

### Day 4: Friday, January 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned and practised about some classical segment trees questions like:
- Range addition updates & get array element value
- Range assignment updates
- Range addition updates & maximum in a range

**Thoughts** Above questions are very popular and implemented using lazy propogation.

### Day 5: Saturday, January 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about registering and login users using MongoDB
2. Password encryption and Hashing using npm packages like md5
3. Worked upon my project

**Thoughts** Above questions are very popular and implemented using lazy propogation.

### Day 6: Sunday, January 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about authentication using node.js & express.js and Hashing using npm package 'bcrypt'
2. Worked upon my project

**Thoughts** bcrypt is very powerful after md5 for hashing and salting.

### Day 7: Monday, January 10th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about cookies & sessions in terms of MERN
2. Worked upon my personal project: Dynamic ToDo List
  - played around with gradients in CSS
  - added a favicon icon (which is really awesome)

**Thoughts** sessions and cookies are both very important when it comes to authentication, safety and user distinction.

**Some useful links**

- [png to ico converter](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico)
- [an issue with chrome and favicon icon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13780402/html-favicon-ico-wont-show-on-google-chrome)

### Day 8: Tuesday, January 11th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about authentication using Passport with mongoose
2. Started a VanillaJS Recipe-app

**Thoughts** you'll need these packages to use passport with mongoose in your node-express app. 
- passport
- express-session
- passport-local
- passport-local-mongoose

### Day 9: Wednesday, January 12th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Completed VanillaJS Recipe-app

**Thoughts** this project provides the revision of async & await, fetch, playing with public API, word-break, overflow, event listeners, etc

**Some links**
- [My Recipe-app repository](https://github.com/chawlajay/JavaScript_projects/tree/master/recipe-app)
- [YT tutorial](https://youtu.be/dtKciwk_si4)

### Day 10: Thursday, January 13th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Completed a simple mark-down notes app using three siblings (HTML,CSS and VanillaJS)
(uses local storage to save notes)

**Thoughts** Used [Marked JS](https://marked.js.org/) with [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked)

**Some links**
- [My Notes-app repository](https://github.com/chawlajay/JavaScript_projects/tree/master/notes-app)
- [YT tutorial](https://youtu.be/dtKciwk_si4)

### Day 11: Friday, January 14th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Started revision on fundamentals of JavaScript as a quick warm-up before starting a new course.
(DOM, chaining, promises, OOP, and more...)

**Thoughts** Back to square one.
