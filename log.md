# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Segment tree implementations from [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html).

**Thoughts** Segment trees are very useful when it comes to range queries problems in competitive programming.

### Day 2: Wednesday, January 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Explored more on Segment trees and completed the tutorial of [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html).
2. Solved 5 problems on SPOJ

**Thoughts** So awesome this tree Data structure is, but needs lots of practice and continuous implementation.
